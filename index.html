        <h2>Questions about Islam</h2>
    </div>
    
<article>
    
    <h3><a>Are Women <span><em>Opressed</em></span> in Islam?</a></h3>
        
    <dl>
        <dt> “Does Islam oppress women?”  I don’t know does it?</dt>
            <dd>This question gets asked so often I feel as though everyone knows the answer but refuse to believe it’s true.
Now let’s see what the Quran actually says along with a few comments Prophet Mohammed (pbuh) actually says about Women.
"O ye who believe! Ye are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Nor should ye treat them with harshness... (The Noble Quran, 4:19)"
The Quran clearly tells us to treat them well.
Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) had said “…the world lies at the feet of mothers.”  
And also
“O’ ye men. Fear Allah and treat your women with kindness.”
There is an entire chapter on the subject of Women to tell us how to treat them with kindness. There is a reason for this as well, because it’s known through history women were just garbage in those times, and only Islam gave them new hope.
</dd>    
        <dt>Now answer me this, does Islam really oppress all women or is there another source in which does all the oppressing?</dt>
            <dd>Non-Muslims jump on Muslims because of the Hijab, it oppresses them, it doesn’t let them show their full features, it makes their self esteem lower and have no confidence in themselves. In other words, the Hijab destroys their personality and ruins their life.
Do we remember the Muslim sisters in France fighting for their right to wear the Hijab? 
Remember the government wanting to ban them from wearing the Hijab? Even in Quebec Muslim sisters are trying to fight for their right to wear the hijab as well. Do you remember how hard they fought to wear the Hijab?    ...Probably not. 
Why? 
Because this isn’t what the Media finds entertaining to show to the world. Why would a Muslim woman want to fight to wear the hijab?

        <dd>It’s extremely odd is it not? In fact it’s not odd at all.In chapter 33, Surah Al-Ahzaab (The Clans), verse 59 Allah the Almighty Says: "O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the woman of the believers to bring down over themselves (part) of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known (as free respectable women) and not be abused. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful." [Qur’an 33:59]
When we look at nuns we think “WOW! Look at how pure and faithful these women are” but when we look at Muslim women we think “Poor women, they are oppressed and forced to wear that.”
Let’s not be hypocritical, there are women who are forced to wear it but 90% of the women want to wear it is to please their Lord. 
It doesn’t matter if you’re atheist, Christian or Jewish. If the Muslim women feel happy dressing that way, what harm does it do to you? Why is it ok for women to be nearly naked outside with those booty shorts and cleavage showing but it is a HUGE problem for women to also be covered? It just doesn’t make sense.
The moment someone sees a Muslim woman covered, they assume ‘Poor girl. She is oppressed and depressed.’ When in fact, they are liberated.
Why is she liberated? How does that make any sense? 
She is no longer valued for something material; she is not valued on her good looks, or the shape of her body, or the beauty of the hair. People will judge her for her kindness, intelligence, honesty and overall personality; people will judge her for who she is as a person, not what she looks like.
Islam changed the lives of women after such a long time; Islam protects women and holds them in high regard. Women were granted independence, they had a right to accept marriage or reject, a right to want divorce, a right to inherit land, a right to work and be educated contrary to what the media shows or the world thinks. In the Qur’an it advises all women and men to gain knowledge and keep learning and be educated.
 Let’s not forget how the world in the past would always kill the daughters to have sons, to help them take care of the work. Women were garbage, they were buried alive, and they were just tossed aside.
Islam gave both men and women equal rights. They may have different roles but their rights are equal. Of course there are many who will throw the verse out that it shows men have more rights and it’s not your fault at all, the translation is at fault.
But fact of the matter is both men and women are equal. The prophet (pbuh) once said, "The best among you are those who are the best to their wives." This shows that Islam highly encourages treating the wives well. They should be respected, cared for and loved. Women should not be harmed in any way physically or mentally.

    <dt>Lets quickly go over the misconceptions.</dt>
        
        <dd>Muslim women are allowed to be beaten by their husbands, they are sex slaves, they are not allowed to work or be educated, they are not allowed to drive, this is all that Islam apparently teaches according to the media.
Firstly, please let us understand the difference between what Islam teaches and what culture teaches. Two very different things, when Islam protects women as a whole. Lets remember what Allah (SWT) says. He says we are all special, we were all created the way we are for a reason, and we should love ourselves because our creator loves us for who we are.
Now lets see the real source of oppression towards women.
